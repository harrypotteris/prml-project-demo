**FRUITS CLASSIFICATION - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND MACHINE LEARNING (CSL2050) COURSE PROJECT**
___

**OVERVIEW** 
This project focuses on fruit classification using the Fruits360 dataset, which contains a total of 94,110 images (training and testing combined) across 141 categories, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. For feature extraction, we used two techniques: Color Histograms and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). We then applied several traditional machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression—on both feature sets to evaluate and compare their performance.
